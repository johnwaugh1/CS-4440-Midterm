1. Install required Python dependencies by running:
   pip install numpy networkx

2. Run the Python script:
   python bayesian.py

   This will check d-separation for given variables, perform exact inference, and approximate inference using Gibbs sampling.

3. Install required R packages by running:
   install.packages("bnlearn")
   install.packages("gRain")

4. Run the R script:
   source("test.R")

   This will check d-separation and perform exact and approximate inference using Gibbs sampling.
